		CppUnit --- The C++ Unit Test Library
		-------------------------------------
		    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net



		INSTALLATION using configure script
		-----------------------------------

See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
each non-standard configure option follows.

  --disable-typeinfo-name 

Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information system is
used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate
the name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this
interface.  Other compilers do not.

If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
this option; the names will be generated by other means.



		System Notes
		------------

IRIX 6 / MIPSpro compiler 7.30
------------------------------

The MIPSpro compiler requires the "-LANG:std" flag to enable the
standard C++ library.  You must set the CC variable when you configure,
as follows
	./configure CC='CC -LANG:std'

There is a bug in released versions of libtool prevents the -LANG flag
from being properly passed during the linking stage.  To check if you
have this bug, examine the output of "grep 'no.*irix' libtool".  If
you see a line like "no/*-*-irix*)" then you suffer from the bug.  [A
fixed version of libtool will look like "no/*-*-irix* | /*-*-irix*)".]

If your libtool script suffers from the bug, open it in an editor,
find the first line that contains "with_gcc", and change it to
read "with_gcc=no".


DEC alpha with cxx V6.1-029 and RougeWave STL
---------------------------------------------

A user report that you may have to configure using

	./configure DEC_CXX="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -D__STD_MS"

[Is that really "RogueWave"?]
