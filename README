		CppUnit --- The C++ Unit Test Library
		-------------------------------------
		    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net



		INSTALLATION using configure script
		-----------------------------------

See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
each non-standard configure option follows.

  --disable-typeinfo-name 

Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information system is
used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate
the name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this
interface.  Other compilers do not.

If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
this option; the names will be generated by other means.



		System Notes
		------------

IRIX 6 / MIPSpro compiler 7.30
------------------------------

The MIPSpro compiler requires the "-LANG:std" flag to enable the
standard C++ library.  You must set the CC variable when you configure,
as follows
	./configure CC='CC -LANG:std'

There is a bug in libtool 1.4c (and presumably earlier?) that prevents
this flag from being properly passed during the linking stage.  After
configuring, run "grep with_gcc libtool" in the top of the source
directory.  If the first line of output reads "with_gcc=", then edit
libtool and change it to read "with_gcc=no".

FIXME: the preceeding is unnecessary if we build the release using
a fixed libtool.


DEC alpha with cxx V6.1-029 and RougeWave STL
---------------------------------------------

A user report that you may have to configure using

	./configure DEC_CXX="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -D__STD_MS"

[Is that really "RogueWave"?]
