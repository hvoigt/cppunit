		CppUnit --- The C++ Unit Test Library
		-------------------------------------
		    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net



		INSTALLATION using configure script
		-----------------------------------

See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
each non-standard configure option follows.

  --disable-typeinfo-name 

Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information system is
used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate
the name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this
interface.  Other compilers do not.

If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
this option; the names will be generated by other means.
