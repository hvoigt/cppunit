          with "make check", not "make all".

2001-04-29 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>
	* Merged Baptiste Lepilleurs CppUnitW 1.2. Some differences:
	  TypeInfo stuff (in TestSuite) compiled in only if USE_TYPEINFO 
	  is set. 
	  TestSuite.getTests now returns a const ref instead of taking a 
	  ref as parameter.

	  auto_ptr cannot be used in containers.

2001-04-15 Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>

	  This should make more clear which headers are used internally only
	  (like estring.h).
	
	* Moved autoconf auxiliary stuff into new subdir config, to make the
	  top dir less crowded.

	* Prefixed std:: to cerr, cout and endl.

	  Patch #403540 / #403542
	
	* cppunit/TestCaller.h: create Fixture with empty constructor so that 
	  only the TestCaller but not the Fixture instance is registered in
