	New in CppUnit 1.6.0
	--------------------

* All CppUnit macros now begin with "CPPUNIT_".  

  Macros CU_TEST_SUITE, CU_TEST, CU_TEST_SUITE_END, CU_TEST_SUB_SUITE,
  and CU_TEST_SUITE_REGISTRATION are renamed but are otherwise unchanged;
  they take the same arguments, and have the same effect.  The old-style
  macros can be used if your sources #define CPPUNIT_ENABLE_CU_TEST_MACROS
  to 1 before including any CppUnit headers.

  Macros assert, assertEqual, and assertDoublesEqual, have been replaced
  by CPPUNIT_ASSERT, CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL, and CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL,
  respectively.  Macro assertLongsEqual is replaced by CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL.
  The old assert macros can be used if your sources #define
  CPPUNIT_ENABLE_NAKED_ASSERT before including any CppUnit headers.


* Equality assertion CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL(expected,actual) can test
  any type of expression.  The types of "expected" and "actual" must
  be the same; use a cast if necessary.


* Equality tested using CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL may be re-defined using
  a traits class.  Ditto for the string representation used in the
  diagnostic messages.


* CppUnit has a unit test for itself!
