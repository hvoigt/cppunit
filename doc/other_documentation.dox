 \section _history History
 The first port of JUnit to C++ was done
 by Michael Feathers. His versions
 can be found on the 
 <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">
 XProgramming software page</a>. They are os-specific,
 so Jerome Lacoste provided a port to Unix/Solaris.
 His version can be found on the same page.
 Now this is an attempt to combine efforts on further 
 development of the library. This version is heavily 
 based on the previous ones, e.g. most of the
 documentation in the code was written by Michael Feathers.

 \section _usage Usage
 Take a look into 
 <a href="../cookbook.html">the CppUnit cookbook</a>.
 It gives a quick start into using this 
 testing framework.
 For a discussion on CppUnit, check 
 <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CppUnit">
 the WikiWiki Pages on CppUnit</a>. There you can also
 find the original versions and various ports to other
 OSses and languages.
 
 \section _license License
 This library is released under
 the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>.
 The previous versions (as mentioned in section \ref _history) 
 had a different license, but the LGPL complies to its 
 requirements.
 
 \section _changes Changes
 - Now there is a CppUnit namespace.
 - CppUnit::TestCase objects register themselves
   in the CppUnit::TestRegistry, which
   can be used by a CppUnit::TestRunner.
 - the CppUnit::TestRunner is factored out of the library.
 - the global defines have been 
   converted into const objects.
 - the Guards.h file is not needed anymore.
 
 \section _whats_next What's next?
 - The CppUnit::Test::getName() method
   will be used to 
   register CppUnit::Test objects in a CppUnit::TestSuite or
   the registry.
 - The library will be made const consistent.
